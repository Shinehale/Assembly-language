## preface

> This folder responds to the tesxbook 《汇编语言 (第三版)》 王爽
>
> It contains my notes and codes.
>
> Because of the lack of  knowledge of the Virtual system
>
> So the left codes about experiment 17 can not be cultivated
>
> If I have that time, or maybe some day I have the grasp of the Virtual system and just at that time I remember this folder and the left Curriculum Designs Two .
>
> I will finish it at that day.
>
> But as the matter of the fact , I have poor memory so it will not be finished.
>
> If you have any problems or find any faults in the code, Please contact with me.
