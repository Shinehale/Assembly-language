This is false.Consider, in fact, one of the examples from the text, with two men and tow women
	m prefer w to w'
	m' prefer w' to w
	w prefer m' to m 
	w' prefer m to m'
Note that there are no pairs at all where each ranks the other first,so clearly no such pair can show up in a stable matching.

consider this situation, there is a pair (m,w) which w and m each ranks the other first. and consider a perfectmatching containing pairs (m, w') and (m',w),hence,not(m,w).so this matching can not be stable,and finally it will changed into a stable matching .

Just like the Gal and Shapley algorithm,we can replace the men with the hospital and the women with the students.the final condition for pausing is all the hositial has been assigend to some students.and all the positions in the hospital can be devided to different persepective parts as the men in the GS algorthim.The process of the new algorithm is the same as the GS, and finally just combine the perspective part into another heap or some other containers to accuilate the outcomes.
